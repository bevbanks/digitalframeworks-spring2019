### Higher kindergarten vaccine rates and personal exemptions may not inhibit measles outbreaks 

As the 2019 measles outbreak surges across the United States, some states with higher vaccination coverage rates for kindergartners still have confirmed cases of the disease despite legal limits on personal exemptions. 

As of June 6 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the existence of 1,022 measles cases across the country. Twenty-eight states have reported measles exposure with Idaho and Virginia most recently added to the list. 

The rapid spread of measles threatens vulnerable populations such as children under 5 years of age. In school settings where children interact in close quarters, the virus is extremely contagious.

In October 2018, the CDC released a study focusing on the vaccination coverage and exemption rates among children in kindergarten during the 2017-2018 school year. 

Researchers assessed the percentages of kindergarteners covered for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, as well as the rate of exemptions for medical issues, religious or personal beliefs. Coverage rates 95 percent or higher were considered the gold standard to create community immunity and lessen the chances for potential outbreaks. 

Out of the 32 states without personal exemptions and a high vaccine rate, nine states reported measles cases this year. States like Virginia and California with high kindergarten vaccine coverage rates have limits on personal exemptions but both have reported measles cases this year. In contrast, D.C. has one of the lowest vaccine rates for kindergarteners as well as limits on personal exemptions but it has yet to report a measles case in 2019. 

In 2015, the California state legislature passed a law that eliminated personal exemptions for vaccines in schools. According to the CDC’s study, California had a 96.9 percent MMR vaccine rate for kindergarteners. 

Carla Black, one of the authors of the study and an epidemiologist at the CDC, noted a rise in California’s coverage rate after the passage of the 2015 law but she also said there still are children at risk who are not exempt and not up to date on vaccinations. These students may contract measles during the conditional enrollment period which is a set number of days that the school gives them to receive all doses of the vaccination. 

Black pointed out how even before the elimination on personal exemptions, California raised its coverage rate through focusing on non-exempt unvaccinated children. 

“The students that don't have an exemption but have been allowed to enter school without being fully immunized, and they (California) kind of cracked down on that.,” Black said. “That is another thing that had an impact on increasing their coverage.”

As more states eliminate personal exemptions, these coverage rates may change but states are still at risk for children who are unvaccinated and not exempt. 

In Washington the kindergarten vaccine rate is 90.6 percent although this rate could change with the enactment of a new personal exemption law on July 28. 

In March Rep. Paul Harris, R-Vancouver, of the Washington State House of Representatives sponsored a bill to eliminate personal exemptions for the MMR vaccine after his district experienced an outbreak. 

“33 states did not have personal exemptions,” Harris said. “I think we became the 34th so the vast majority of states don't allow personal exemptions.” 

As of June 10, the Washington State Health Department reported 81 cases of measles in the state with 52 of those cases affecting children between one and 10 years old. 

As an immunization health promotion advisor in the department, Danielle Koenig has worked to increase vaccine coverage and ensure community immunity for children that are exempt or currently unvaccinated. 

“Right now we do have the benefit in Washington that more than nine out of 10 kindergartners are vaccinated against measles,” Koenig said. “We’d really like to see that around 95 percent or higher to prevent measles.” 

In terms of whether the new legislation will increase Washington’s coverage rate to 95 percent, Harris said he will “ wait and see” what happens a couple of years after the law has taken effect. 

“That five-percent is very important and it'll be interesting to see where we end at with what’s gone on,” Harris said. 

Unlike Washington and California, D.C. has the lowest kindergarten vaccination rate at 81.3 percent even with legal limits on personal exemptions.  

Dr. Anjali Talwalkar is the senior deputy director for the community health administration in the D.C. Department of Health and she said her office is monitoring the completion of both MMR doses to ensure kids are completely vaccinated. 

“We closely track for measles and for children, immunizations and vaccinations related to the date of birth for a child.” Talwalkar said. “Pretty much any day a child might have a birthday and they can become due or overdue or a vaccine.” 

Given the recently reported cases in Northern Virginia and the Baltimore area, Black said D.C. is at risk but the close proximity of children in a school exposed to measles is a larger factor in a potential outbreak. 

“Yes there probably is a risk there because remember kids can be unvaccinated but as long as there’s no exposure,” Black said. “They are not going to get measles.” 

This week Virginia reported measles cases linked to a passenger who contracted the disease abroad and brought it back to Dulles International airport. 

Marshall Vogt, an epidemiologist at the Virginia Department of Health, said the state’s lack of personal exemptions has helped keep overall exemption rates down and maintain a higher coverage rate. Despite having a 95.5 percent vaccination rate for kindergartners, Virginia’s biggest issue is preventing disease from other countries. 

“That’s why we're still going to see cases even if we had a 100 percent vaccination rate because cases would be imported from other countries,” Vogt said. 

Mississippi and West Virginia have the highest kindergarten vaccination coverage for measles in the country at 99.4 percent and 98.4 percent respectively. These states are examples in which strict exemption rates may translate to higher vaccine coverage and less outbreaks. 

According to the West Virginia Department of Health, West Virginia has not had a confirmed measles case since 2009 or an outbreak since 1994 which may be linked to their laws against person and religious exemptions.
