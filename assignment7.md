### Assignment 7: Find a Story

###### Summary: 
In FEC filings for indepdent expenditures I found that more indepdent expenditures were made in the last six months support of Trump compared to the first six months after he decided to run. Opposition expensitures were slightly higher at this point in 2019 than in 2015. 

###### Pitch: 
I would compare the sum of how much money was allocated at this point in 2019 for supporting and opposing independent expenditures than in 2015. I would also interview some of the spenders who created advertisemnts and other campaign materials for Trump. I would ask them about their support or opposition digital, television or online advertisments. These compoeenets could be embedded into the story for visualization. This story would likely take me three days to report. 

###### Data Diary: 
In order to find my story I did the following: 

- Searched the FEC website for independent expenditures in 2019 and 2015 for "Donald J. Trump"
- For 2019 I filtered to contributions between 01/01/2019 to today
- For 2015 I filtered to contributions between 06/16/2015 (the day Trump announced) and six months later on 11/16/2015
- Filtered "President" for office sought category
- Filtered to contributions that "support" or "opposed" Trump in both years
- For all 4 CSVs I:
  - took the sum of the expenditure_amount column for 2019 and 2015 support and opposition expenditures
  - made a pivot table to highlight the top contributors for support and opposition in each filtered time period for both       years. 


###### Headline: 

Trump's current supporting independent campaign expenditures outpace 2015 levels

###### Nut Graf:

The independent expenditures supporting President Trump after he announced his candidacy in 2015 have increased almost 19 times. The expenditures in support of the President for 2019 totaled almost  . 

Opposition expenditures increased
