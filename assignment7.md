### Assignment 7: Find a Story

###### Summary: 
In FEC filings for independent expenditures I found that supporting expenditures were much higher at this point in 2019 than at the point following Trump's campaign announcement in 2015. Opposition spending was only slightly higher in the first six months of 2019 than in the first six months after Trump decided to run.  

###### Pitch: 
I would compare the sum of how much money was allocated at this point in 2019 for opposing and supporting independent expenditures than in 2015. I would also interview some of the spenders who created advertisemnts and other campaign materials for and against Trump. I would ask them about their support or opposition within digital, television or online advertisements. These advertisements could be embedded into the story for visualization. This story would likely take me three days to report. 

###### Data Diary: 
In order to find my story I did the following: 

- Searched the FEC website for independent expenditures in 2019 and 2015 for "Donald J. Trump"
- For 2019 I filtered to contributions between 01/01/2019 to today
- For 2015 I filtered to contributions between 06/16/2015 (the day Trump announced) and six months later on 11/16/2015
- Filtered "President" for the office sought category
- Filtered to contributions that "support" or "opposed" Trump in both years
- For all 4 CSVs, I:
  - took the sum of the *expenditure_amount* column for 2019 and 2015 support and opposition expenditures
  - made a pivot table to highlight the top contributors for support and opposition in each filtered time period 

###### Headline: 

Trump's 2019 supporting independent campaign expenditures outpace 2015 levels

###### Nut Graf:

The independent expenditures supporting President Trump after he announced his candidacy in 2015 have increased almost 19 times from $454,714.65 in 2015 to $8,828,904.93. 

Opposition expenditures increased moderately from $1,271,664.17 to $1,652,489.43.
