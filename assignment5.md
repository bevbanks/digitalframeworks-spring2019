###### Steps to Clean Data: 

1. I found and replaced all of the blank cells with 0. 
2. I removed all _ from the name headers. 
3. In the grade levels AF column, I removed all of the dates next to the grade level numbers for consistency. I used formatted these numbers from dates to actual numbers that reflect the grade level. For instance, 8-July became 8. 
4. After cleaning the data, I created a pivot table.
5. First I selected all the data using the shortcut Command A.
6. Then I clicked data on the menu bar and seelected 'Summarize with PivotTable.'
7. Next, I organized the average of Percent complete for all immunizations, average of Percent exempt for measles mumps rubella, average of Number exempt for varicella, and the average of Percent with any exemption.

A link to the dataset (which you can include in your repository), your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.
Additionally, write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.
Lastly, write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.
This analysis can be related to your final project, but does not have to be.
