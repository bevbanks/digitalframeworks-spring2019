The recent measles outbreak across the U.S. has prompted multiple lawmakers to introduce legislation related to improved vaccine care. These Republican and Democrat lawmakers serve many constituents and I wondered if theyâ€™re championing of vaccines is linked to recent outbreaks in their district and lobbying from healthcare industries.
