###### Story Idea 1: U.S. Measles Outbreaks

Measles outbreaks in the United States are on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles outbreaks have risen from 63 cases in 2010 to 555 cases so far in 2019.  The recent outbreak in a Brooklyn neighborhood and the outbreak in New Jersey earlier this year are two examples of the measles resurgence. Anti-vaccination sentiments and state restrictions on compulsory vaccinations impact how health officials handle future outbreaks for other types of infectious diseases. For this project, my goal is to use data to answer how many state vaccination laws impacting the recent measles outbreaks ?

| Year |  Outbreaks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 2010 | 63         |
| 2011 | 220        |
| 2012 | 55        |
| 2013 | 187        |
| 2014 | 667        |
| 2015 | 188        |
| 2016 | 86         |
| 2017 | 120        |
| 2018 | 372        |
| 2019 | 555        |

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * My ranking is a 4. The central insight the reporter is trying to communicate is that state law exemptions for vaccines may impact the rate of outbreaks. Part of this insight is in the headline which mentions students being exempt from mandatory vaccines. The only issue with the story is that the article does not clearly define the different outcomes between non-medical and medical exemptions as it relates to outbreaks. 
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * My ranking is a 5. I was able to understand how to navigate through the different data visualizations. The most efficient way to naivate was by using the mouse to hover over the line graph and the map. My suggestion to improve navigation is for the map's labeling. It would be more helpful to include information for the different points noted on the map. For instance, when I click on Palisades Center, it would be more informative to include the number of outbreaks in addition to a photo of the location. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * My ranking is a 4. While I think most of the data is accurate, I wish the repeorter had included all of the data from the [CDC School Vaccination Assessment Program report]{https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/data-reports/coverage-trend/index.html) which was listed at the bottom of the line graph. For example, it would have been helful to include the percentage of vaccination coverage by state which would have given more context about the tates with the least strict vaccination laws.  For the map graphic, there should have been more information provided about the different points on the map. Also, the reporter did not provide a source for their information. Without a source, I question whether the locations on the map are actually hubs for outbreaks in the New York region. In this instance I felt that the reporter did not fully explain the purpose of the map graphic in regards to the overall story. The map failed to give any further context to the story or help the audience have a better understanding of the severity of these outbreaks. I would suggest that the reporter contact the CDC's [Adivistory Committee on Immunizations Practices](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html) and expert [Jennifer McQuiston](https://www.cdc.gov/media/spokesperson/mcquiston/index.html) who is the Deputy Director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology for more information on outbreaks. Additioanlly, the reporter should contact the state health departments to obtain more detailde information on the outbreak cases in the locations labeled in the map. 
   
### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * My ranking is a 4. Overall, I felt that the story succeeded in informing the audience about the places where the outbreaeks are occurring and the possible correlation to vaccination exmeptions for state laws. The line graph provided a great comparison between the national average  and state level non-exemptions. The area of improvement includes a more informative map that engages the reader with data tying the severity of an outbreak to the location.  
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * I think the line graph succeeded in all of these tasks but the map did not. The map had great presetnation but the lack of organized data caused the map to fail at comparing outbreaks in New York and New Jersey to other states. 

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * My rating for the line graph is a 4 for type and color. The reporter did used an appropriate font and color to inform the reader of the importance of data sets in the line graph. The type was clear and concise which helped the reader connect the percentages of non-exemptions to the state. All of the data points were relevant within the line graph and were hightled by the different hues of blue. Each color helped engage the audience with why the data was important to the story. 
   
   * My rating for the map is 2 for type and 4 for color. The reporter's lack of text for each data point hurt the overall impact of this graphic. If text could have popped up when the audience hovered over each point, the rating for type would have been stronger. The color choice for the points of outbreak helped identify which areas were most important to the spread of measles in New York and New Jersey. The orange color with white rings was easily identifiable and made sense to point out those data points. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * My rating is a 3. The hover tool on the line graph was a great effect to engage the reader and added to the overall effeectiveness of the visualization. As for the map, I think more creative effects could have been added to engage the audience with the points of outbreak. One of those effects could have been the pop up of information with a hover tool or creating a map graphic outside of google maps so that use had more control over selecting data points. 

###### Story Idea 2: Animal Protection Laws

The evolution of animal rights recognition has manifested itself in some U.S. state laws. The Animal Legal Defense Fund released their rankings for the states with the strongest and weakest animal protection laws. States like Illinois, Louisiana, and Virginia have the most protections while and North Dakota, Georgia, and Kentucky have the least. There are different types of companies that benefit from lax animal protection laws. For this project, I want to use data to answer how businesses connected to animal rights abuses are taking advantage of weaker animal protection laws in the states with the weak animal protection statues? 

| State  | Ranking |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Illinois  | 1  |
| Oregon  | 2 |
| Maine  | 3 |
| Iowa  | 48 |
| Mississippi | 49 |
| Kentucky  | 50 |

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * My rating is a 3. The central insight for this text story is the strength of animal cruelty laws in the United States but I understood that mainly through the headline. Most of the story did not provide organized data to support the lede . about animal rights legislation in Florida.  
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * My rating is a 1. The data was not placed in a graphic but rather hyperlinked within the story. This was the least efficient way for the audience to understand the importance of data to the story because it requires clicking out of the article. My suggestion would have been to provide an interactive column chart that highlighted the states with the weakest and strongest animal protections.  
   
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * While I think the data was accurate, I question the reporter's sole use of data from one source particularly a source with known for animal rights advocacy. The heart of this story was based only on the report from the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the reporter did not further explain how the non-profit collected their data. I suggest that the reporter contact the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/state-and-local) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/labeling/claims/ucm2005202.htm) to provide a more balanced story related to animal rights protections. Additionally, the reporter should contact the sponsors for the Florida legislation mentioned in the story. 
   
### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * My ranking is a 2. The reporter did well in connecting the importance of the data to the overall story but there are serious improvements needed to make this text story more visual. The lack of any graphic hurts the impact of this story for the audience. If the reporter had included a map of state laws or a graphic pointing to the rise of U.S. animal cruelty laws, then the story would have succeeded in presenting, comparing, organzing, and correlating the data.  
   
### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   The lack of a graphic in this text story renders the following question unanswerable; however, I have a few suggestions for how color and type could have created an effective graphic. If the author had included a line graph to compare the increase or decrease of state animal cruelty laws. The graph could have used the colors purple, orange, green, and blue to differentiate between the different states. Bold type could have been used when the audience hovered over a data point to show the number of legislation on the books during a certain year. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * My rating is a 1. There was great potential for data visuzaltion in this article but the reporter failed to include a graphic. Even though the data from the Animal Legal Defense Fund should not have been the sole source, a column graphic comparing states'number of restrictions would have engaged the audience in a meaningful way. The only element used in this story included a video from a news station that had very little to do with the legal side of animal rights or with the lede of the story.
