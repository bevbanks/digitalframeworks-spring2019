###### Story Idea 1: U.S. Measles Outbreaks

Measles outbreaks in the United States are on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles outbreaks have risen from 63 cases in 2010 to 555 cases so far in 2019.  The recent outbreak in a Brooklyn neighborhood and the outbreak in New Jersey earlier this year are two examples of the measles resurgence. Anti-vaccination sentiments and state restrictions on compulsory vaccinations impact how health officials handle future outbreaks for other types of infectious diseases. For this project, my goal is to use data to answer how many state vaccination laws impacting the recent measles outbreaks ?

| Year |  Outbreaks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 2010 | 63         |
| 2011 | 220        |
| 2012 | 55        |
| 2013 | 187        |
| 2014 | 667        |
| 2015 | 188        |
| 2016 | 86         |
| 2017 | 120        |
| 2018 | 372        |
| 2019 | 555        |

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * My ranking is a 4. The central insight the reporter is trying to communicate is that state law exemptions for vaccines may impact the rate of outbreaks. Part of this insight is in the headline which mentions students being exempt from mandatory vaccines. The only issue with the story is that the article does not clearly define the different outcomes between non-medical and medical exemptions as it relates to outbreaks. 
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * My ranking is a 5. I was able to understand how to navigate through the different data visualizations. The most efficient way to naivate was by using the mouse to hover over the line graph and the map. My suggestion to improve navigation is for the map's labeling. It would be more helpful to include information for the different points noted on the map. For instance, when I click on Palisades Center, it would be more informative to include the number of outbreaks in addition to a photo of the location. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * My ranking is a 3. While I think most of the data is accurate, I wish the repeorter had included all of the data from the CDC School Vaccination Assessment Program report which was listed at the bottom of the line graph. For example, List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

   For the map graphic, there should have been more information provided about the different points on the map. Also, the reporter did not provide a source for their information. Without a source, I question whether the locations on the map are actually hubs for outbreaks in the New York region. I would suggest the reporter check with . In this instance I felt that the reporter did not fully explain the purpose of the graphic in regards to the overall story. 

   
### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * My rating for the line graph is a 4. The reporter did use color to inform the reader of the importance of data sets in the line graph. For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
*Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
   My rating for the map graphic is a 3. Although the map graphic did not include enoguh data, I think the reporter effectively used the red 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * My rating is a 3. Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 



###### Story Idea 2: Animal Protection Laws

The evolution of animal rights recognition has manifested itself in some U.S. state laws. The Animal Legal Defense Fund released their rankings for the states with the strongest and weakest animal protection laws. States like Illinois, Louisiana, and Virginia have the most protections while and North Dakota, Georgia, and Kentucky have the least. There are different types of companies that benefit from lax animal protection laws. For this project, I want to use data to answer how businesses connected to animal rights abuses are taking advantage of weaker animal protection laws in the states with the weak animal protection statues? 

| State  | Ranking |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Illinois  | 1  |
| Oregon  | 2 |
| Maine  | 3 |
| Iowa  | 48 |
| Mississippi | 49 |
| Kentucky  | 50 |
