### Lawmakers and Vaccination Legislation

The recent measles outbreak across the U.S. has prompted multiple lawmakers to introduce legislation related to improved vaccine care. These Republican and Democrat lawmakers serve many constituents and I wondered if theyâ€™re championing of vaccines is linked to recent outbreaks in their district and lobbying from healthcare industries. For instance, is Rep. Bryan Higgins, D-New York, motivated to sponsor legislation because of the recent outbreaks in his district or from outside lobbying influence? Since the vaccine outbreak has become more prominent, I am interested to see how lawmakers and health industries are connected in promoting vaccines to the public. 

- The name of the legislation as it relates to any type of vaccination
- The date of when the legislation was introduced 
- The name of the legislator who sponsored the bill or resolution
- The congressional district of the sponsor 
- A tweet about vaccines or the legislation 
- A link to state Health Department Press Releases 
- A list of campaign contributions from health professionals
- A list of campaign contributions from pharmaceuticals
