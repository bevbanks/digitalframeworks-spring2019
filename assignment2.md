### Lawmakers and Vaccination Legislation

The recent measles outbreak across the U.S. has prompted multiple lawmakers to introduce legislation related to improved vaccine care. These Republican and Democratic lawmakers serve many constituents and I wondered if theyâ€™re championing of vaccines is linked to recent outbreaks in their district as well as lobbying from the health industry. For instance, is Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., motivated to sponsor legislation because of the recent outbreaks in his district or because of outside lobbying influence? Since the vaccine outbreak has become more prominent, I am interested to see how lawmakers and health industries are connected in promoting vaccines to the public. 

##### Data points to be collected 

- The name of the legislation as it relates to any type of vaccination (the legislation can include information about any type of disease that is curable with a vaccine but must include language about vaccines)  
- The date of when the legislation was introduced 
- The name of the legislator who sponsored the bill or resolution
- The party affiliation of the member (Republican, Democrat or Independent) 
- The congressional district of the sponsor 
- A link to the lawmaker's tweet about vaccines or the legislation (the tweet shows how the lawmaker is communicating the legislation to the public) 
- A link to state health department press releases with number of most recent cases of measles reported (the number of cases per state shows the severity of the problem in each district)
- A list of campaign contributions from health professionals
- A list of campaign contributions from pharmaceuticals (the numbers for contributions from both health professionals and pharmaceuticals indicate the level of influence the industry has over a particular lawmaker)

I will collect the data by checking congressional databases like congress.gov for legislation that was introduced about vaccines. I will use Twitter to check lawmakers' accounts for tweets about vaccines or the sponsored legislation. I will use OpenSecrets.org to find information related to contributions from health professionals and pharmaceuticals in the 2018 cycle. Lastly, I will find the number of outbreaks in 2019 for a representative's state through health department press releases.
