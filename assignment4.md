### Assignment 4

###### Pitch


I plan to analyze the relationship between lawmakers who sponsor pro-vaccination legislation and the vaccination rates in their respective districts. What are the vaccination rates in each of these lawmakers’ counties? Are the rates higher or lower in these counties? I’m also interested in the timeliness of introducing vaccine legislation with the occurrence of measles outbreak in each members’ state.

I will use data from state health departments to calculate the vaccination rates by county for each members’ state as well as data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a comparison to national vaccination rates. 

I could visualize the vaccination rates per county and line up that data to match the lawmaker who sponsored vaccine legislation on the federal level for that state. Also, I could visualize the current measles outbreak in each of these respective states. 

This story is timely because measle outbreaks have resurged in the United States and sparked a discussion on the rates of vaccinations across the country. 

For sources, I could speak with the offices for the members of Congress who have proposed vaccine legislation. In addition, I could speak with a vaccine specialist at the CDC who could provide more context for the vaccination rate data, and speak with state health department officials about vaccination rates per county.
