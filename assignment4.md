### Pitch


Develop and write out your final story pitch. Schedule a time to talk with me about it (should take about 20 minutes) either in person or on the phone.

As part of your pitch, please include the following:

1. What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)
1. Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it
1. What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
1. What your news hook is - why is this timely?
1. What question will you answer with your data, and why is it newsworthy?

You can choose whether to talk to me about the pitch before or after submitting the written pitch on Github, but both should be done by the beginning of class.
